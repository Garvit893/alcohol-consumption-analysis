## üìñ Project Overview

This project is an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global alcohol consumption patterns, with a special focus on understanding the unique and evolving market of **India**. While global trends often point towards mature, stable markets, this analysis uncovers that India is a "sleeping giant"‚Äîa market characterized by a low consumption baseline but a rapidly accelerating growth trajectory, distinct cultural preferences, and a significant gender consumption gap.

The goal of this analysis is to move beyond surface-level averages to tell a data-driven story about the demographic and cultural factors shaping consumption, providing actionable insights for public health officials and market strategists.

## üìà Key Questions & Analytical Approach

This project seeks to answer four primary questions through a structured, step-by-step approach:

1.  **Consumption Baseline:** How does India's per-capita alcohol consumption rank globally?
2.  **Trend Analysis:** Is India's consumption trend accelerating compared to the global average?
3.  **Gender Dynamics:** How significant is the gender gap in India versus the world, and what does the consumption lifecycle look like across age groups?
4.  **Cultural Preference:** How do drink preferences (spirits, beer, wine) correlate with national consumption levels?

The analysis involves data cleaning, merging multiple datasets, feature engineering (e.g., calculating gender gap ratios), and creating a series of visualizations to build a cohesive narrative.

## ‚ú® Key Findings & Visualizations

### 1. India's Consumption is Low but Growing Fast
While India ranks in the lower half of countries for per-capita consumption, its growth trajectory since 2005 has been significantly steeper than the stable global average.

### 2. A Hyper-Gendered Consumption Model
The national average in India masks a reality of two extremes: a male population with an intense, late-peaking consumption lifecycle and a female population with historically negligible participation. This creates one of the largest gender consumption gaps in the world.

### 3. Spirits Dominate with a Unique Risk Profile
Unlike many Western nations where beer is primary, **spirits are the beverage of choice in India**. This preference, combined with the intense, male-dominated consumption pattern, points to a model of high-intensity drinking within a core demographic.

## üéØ Strategic Recommendations

Based on the findings, the project concludes with actionable recommendations for two key stakeholders:

#### For Public Health Officials:
*   Launch targeted campaigns focused on the primary consuming demographic: **males aged 25-55**, with messaging specific to the risks of spirits.
*   Proactively develop educational materials for women to foster a culture of moderation as social norms evolve.

#### For Market Analysts & Businesses:
*   Avoid a "one-size-fits-all" global strategy; a successful market entry in India must acknowledge the cultural preference for spirits.
*   Segment the market between the established "volume market" (spirits-consuming males) and the nascent "growth market" (urban youth and women).
